Findings & Insights
We can identify top YouTubers related to a specific content theme (e.g., Gaming, Music, Education). These creators serve as references or inspiration for new content strategies.
From analyzing their performance, we gain:
-Content Style: Types of videos that resonate with large audiences.
-Target Audience: Demographics and communities to focus on.
-Subscriber Growth Strategy: Techniques like consistency, engagement, and collaborations.
-Upload Timing: Optimal frequency and scheduling practices for better reach.

I integrate the IBM Granite 3.3-8B Instruct model via Replicate API to assist in strategic recommendations. Here's how AI is used:
-Input: A theme or content idea (e.g., "I want to make gaming content")
-AI Output: High-level content strategy ideas based on trends, tone, audience engagement, and consistency tips.
This approach blends real-world quantitative insights with AI-generated qualitative strategy, offering creators a more holistic planning tool.
